I'm currently working on Veloren, which is hosted on gitlab, So you wouldn't see any veloren contributions here(though there exists a mirror, which I think should make my github account get these contributions). My gitlab account: https://gitlab.com/Inojelis

Also I have sometimes ideas of my own for clippy and rust lang itself, so these contributions you'll see here
